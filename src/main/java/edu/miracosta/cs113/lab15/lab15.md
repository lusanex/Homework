# Advantage and disadvantages

1.- Adjacency Matrix

- Uses O(n^2);
- Does not grow it is fixed.
- It is slow to iterate over all edges
- O(1) new edge
- O(1) to lookup for a specific edge.

2. Adjacency List

- Handles better the sparce graphs
- Fast to iterate over all edges.
- Fast to add and delete a node.
